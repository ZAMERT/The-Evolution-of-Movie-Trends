# The Evolution of Movie Trends

## Overview

This project is aimed at analyzing the relationship between movie genres, audience preferences, and streaming platforms' choices. By analyzing random movies data from IMDB, Amazon, Disney+, and Netflix, we aim to understand how movies trends have evolved over time.

In the following part of the project, we deal with the chosen datasets with data manipulation and visualization tools. We will further analyze the data with the application of machine learning techniques in the following months, in order to find the evolution of movie trends in the industry.

## Motivation

Movies are one of the essentials in our daily life, and watching movies is a very popular form of entertainment and relaxation. Since 28 December 1895, when the Lumiere brothers' had held the first commercial, public screening of ten short films in Paris (Wikipedia, History of film), the film industry has achieved significant growth worldwide. Over the past 130 years, with the vigorous development of technology, the way people watched movies has also been constantly changing, which in turn has influenced the production, distribution and consumption of films. As a result, various genres of movies have emerged throughout the history, and the entire industry has flourished. <br>

In recent decades, the film industry has undergone another major transformation (Wikipedia, History of Film): a rapid shift toward streaming platforms such as Amazon, Netflix, and Disney+. These streaming platforms, together with the cinemas, now represent two dominant modes of film distribution, which also bring new challenges and opportunities for the future development of the film industry. <br>
<br>
Given the rapid shifts, we were motivated to explore how people's preferences, production factors, and streaming platforms' choices jointly shape and transform the movie industry. Our goal is to apply our data science skills and concepts to deal with the following three real-world questions:<br>
<br>
<b>1.  What are the differences in people's preferences for different genres of movies over time?</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By answering this question, we aim to identify the most popular movie genres in every five-year period, analyze how these trends have evolved over time, and examine how global events have influenced audience preferences. We hope that this model can be used to predict the genres of movies that will be popular in the future.<br>
<br>
<b>2.  What are the main factors that influence the box office?</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What factors truly determine a film’s commercial success? Is it the director, the main cast, audience ratings and reputation, film duration, or genre? To what extent does each of these factors contribute to box office performance? By exploring this question, we aim to develop a model capable of predicting the likelihood of a film achieving high box office revenue.<br>
<br>
<b>3.  Do streaming platforms have specific preferences in the genres of movies they release?</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By comparing the proportion of various genres of movies shown on each platform, we hope to help movies choose the streaming platform for their release, thereby increasing the likelihood of achieving success online. <br>
<br>
<b> In general, by dealing with these three questions, we aim to understand how the development of technology and the production process of movies has influenced audience preferences and economic outcomes in the movie industry worldwide, and set up a model which helps make future films more likely to be successful.</b>
